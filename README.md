# Plot Bot Sentiment Analyzer:
- This repository is home to a basic twitter bot that runs a sentiment analysis on various twitter profiles as requested. The bot is hosted on heroku, which means that I did have to turn it off to avoid fees.

# Technology Used:
- Python, heroku, matplotlib, tweepy, vaderSentiment analysis package, datetime, pandas, and numpy.

# Bot location:
- https://twitter.com/GDBootCamp
